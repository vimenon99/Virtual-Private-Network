Here's a `README.md` file for your GitHub repository that includes a description of your VPN implementation using TUN/TAP interfaces, along with usage instructions:

# Mini-VPN Implementation

This repository contains a Python-based implementation of a simple Virtual Private Network (VPN) using TUN/TAP interfaces and UDP for communication. The VPN allows secure and reliable communication between two endpoints over a network.

## Overview

The VPN is implemented using two Python scripts that create virtual network interfaces, handle UDP packet forwarding, and manage the communication between two endpoints. The implementation uses the `scapy` library for packet handling and `socket` library for UDP communication.

### Features
- **TUN/TAP Interface Creation:** Utilizes Linux TUN/TAP interfaces to create virtual network devices.
- **UDP Communication:** Handles packet forwarding between endpoints using UDP.
- **Scapy Integration:** Uses the `scapy` library for network packet manipulation.

## Files

### `client.py`

This script sets up a TUN interface on the client side, assigns an IP address, and forwards packets between the TUN interface and a UDP socket.

**Key Operations:**
- Creates and configures the TUN interface.
- Listens for packets from the TUN interface and UDP socket.
- Forwards packets between the TUN interface and UDP socket.

### `server.py`

This script sets up a TUN interface on the server side, assigns an IP address, and manages the communication with the client through a UDP socket.

**Key Operations:**
- Creates and configures the TUN interface.
- Listens for packets from the TUN interface and UDP socket.
- Forwards packets between the TUN interface and UDP socket.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `scapy` library

To install the required Python library, run:

```bash
pip install scapy
```

## Usage

1. **Run the Server:**

   ```bash
   sudo python3 server.py
   ```

2. **Run the Client:**

   ```bash
   sudo python3 client.py
   ```

   Make sure to update the `ip` and `port` variables in both scripts to match the server and client configurations.

## Notes

- Ensure you have proper permissions to create and manage TUN/TAP interfaces.
- The scripts require superuser (root) privileges to run due to network interface creation and management.
